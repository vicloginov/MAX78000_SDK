/**
 * @file    main.c
 * @brief   Parallel camera example with the OV7692.
 *
 * @details This example uses the UART to stream out the image captured from the camera.
 *          The image is prepended with a header that is interpreted by the grab_image.py
 *          python script.  The data from this example through the UART is in a binary format.
 *          Instructions: 1) Load and execute this example. The example will initialize the camera
 *                        and start the repeating binary output of camera frame data.
 *                        2) Run 'sudo grab_image.py /dev/ttyUSB0 115200'
 *                           Substitute the /dev/ttyUSB0 string for the serial port on your system.
 *                           The python program will read in the binary data from this example and
 *                           output a png image.
